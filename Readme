This contains documentation as to setting up an ansible server, it's a little sloppy, but I understand it so it works for me. 
I intend to update it soon. 

Setting up and ansible server 

Task 1) 

Final project for Comp 698

Docker cloud test, this needs to be addressed first as these are the files that will be running on the server 
Clone the repo from https://github.com/Iadaly/docker-cloud-test2 

I just made the git hub repo, and the docker repo for my final. things are going smoothly.

Uhh so I cloned the repo to my system. I added most of the files from docker-cloud-test2. Not including the ansible files. I made three branches. master, firstBranch, and Compare. master and firestBranch have been merged. All of this has been pushed to github. I also did a pull request between master and Compare, and there are no conflicts.`-
This means that the repo can be pulled and used as is

    * first flask server
    * Web Server
    * ansible configuration
    * metrics page
Task 2) creating the flask server 

Part 1) ssh into the server using the command line 
The format should be as follows:
ssh -1 keyname.key usetname@ipaddress  

The current command to get into the server:
ssh -i /home/tyrion/Documents/idaly-1492664667.key idaly@54.193.53.39

It should be noted that Server had been wiped, as was expected 

Checked 54.193.53.39:8080 for giggles, it’s there but it refuses to connect, not shocking as I’ve loaded nothing onto the site. 

It’s at this point where I’m going to try and setup the server 

Task 3) Configure the server

# Check that the docker service is actually running
ps aux | grep docker
# Check that you can run a simple container
docker run ubuntu:xenial echo "hello world"
Git clone a copy of your docker-cloud-test repo onto the server.
Git clone https://github.com/Iadaly/698-Final.git
You should be able to run the following commands.
# This will build a local image of your docker cloud Flask server
docker build -t test /path/to/Dockerfile
# Verify that git works
git log --oneline --decorate
sudo apt install docker.io - docker needs to be installed 
sudo docker build -t test /home/idaly/698-Final
git log --oneline --decorate

4) Pull the latest copy of your public docker-cloud-test image.

sudo docker pull thedalyshow/final-cloud-test:latest
sudo docker run thedalyshow/final-cloud-test ls
sudo docker images

5) start a container using your public docker-cloud-test image.

sudo docker run -d -p 8080:8080 thedalyshow/final-cloud-test python3 unh698.py
sudo docker ps -a


It is at this point I’m running into issues. I created an image, however there is no site at the ip 
54.193.53.39:8080 or 54.193.53.39:8081
I also created a new image using 8081:8081, although I’m not sure if that’s correct
